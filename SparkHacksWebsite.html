SO here's the deal in how we can start this

First, a log in page with a username and password
if all those are correct (Use may key stuff from C++ idk)
then we got ot heir page

On that page, we have a list of different buttons
based on the kinds of crops the have
Clicking on those buttons will result in showing
data for that crop, like soil water levels idk

and thats it.  just make it look pretty for
cool visibulitiy.

this is prone to changes.  this is just something 
to get ourselves started
